One of the most ancient cities in India, Pushkar is located on the banks of Pushkar Lake. The date when this place came to existence may remain unknown; But Lord Brahma is known to be the creator. The mythology associated with this place narrates a legend that Lord Brahma performed sacrament here for 60000 years to have a sight of Lord Vishnu.',\n",
