## What is a Chatbot

A ChatBot is a Computer Program you can talk to, through messaging apps , chat windows or increasingly by voice. The Chatbot replies using the same applications, creating back a back-and-forth conversation.

Although, ChatBots are a current hot topic,they have been around for the past fifty years . Perhaps the earliest example was a program called Eliza built
in 1966, which simulated a therapist by using a script to a user’s typed questions with simple pattern matching . Over the years, other ChatBots have incorporated more sophisticated techniques to better understand user questions and provide more relevant and useful responses.

## Types of ChatBot

  ### 1.  Support/action chatbots:
Such bots should master a single domain, e.g., know everything about a company, so that they can walk users through any business process or answer various questions. Support chatbots must be easy to navigate, fast in completing tasks, as well as possess a personality multi-turn capability, and context awareness.
 
  ### 2.   Skills chatbots:
These are typically more single-turn-type bots. They have set commands like “Open the garage door” or “Play me the song of an acorn woodpecker,” which they should perform quickly. Speech functionality is desirable for this type of applications, so there’s no need to press any buttons. It’s also important to focus on integration, especially when controlling smart home devices. 

  ### 3. Assistant chatbots:
Assistants are a middle ground between the above types of chatbots. They can respond to questions on any topic and are conversational and entertaining. Siri is a great example. Such bots may eventually become powerful marketing platforms and navigators of all other bots that are currently out there
